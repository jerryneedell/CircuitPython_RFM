# Simple demo of sending and recieving data with the rfm9x FSK radio.

# Define radio parameters.
RADIO_FREQ_MHZ = 915.0  # Frequency of the radio in Mhz. Must match your
# module! Can be a value like 915.0, 433.0, etc.

# Define pins connected to the chip, use these if wiring up the breakout according to the guide:
CS = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.CE1)
RESET = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D25)

# Initialize SPI bus.
spi = busio.SPI(board.SCK, MOSI=board.MOSI, MISO=board.MISO)

# Initialze RFM radio
rfm9xfsk = rfm9xfsk.RFM9xFSK(spi, CS, RESET, RADIO_FREQ_MHZ)

# Print out some chip state:
print("Temperature: {0}C".format(rfm9xfsk.temperature))
print("Frequency: {0}mhz".format(rfm9xfsk.frequency_mhz))
print("Bit rate: {0}kbit/s".format(rfm9xfsk.bitrate / 1000))

# Send a packet.  Note you can only send a packet up to 60 bytes in length.
# This is a limitation of the radio packet size, so if you need to send larger
# amounts of data you will need to break it into smaller send calls.  Each send
# call will wait for the previous one to finish before continuing.

# Wait to receive packets.  Note that this library can't receive data at a fast
# rate, in fact it can only receive and process one 60 byte packet at a time.
# This means you should only use this for low bandwidth scenarios, like sending
# and receiving a single message at a time.
