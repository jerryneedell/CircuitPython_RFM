# Define radio parameters.
RADIO_FREQ_MHZ = 915.0  # Frequency of the radio in Mhz. Must match your

# Define pins connected to the chip, use these if wiring up the breakout according to the guide:
CS = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.CE1)
RESET = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D25)

# Initialize SPI bus.

# Initialze RFM radio

# Wait to receive packets.
print("Waiting for packets...")
# initialize flag and timer
while True:
    # Look for a new packet: only accept if addresses to my_node
    packet = rfm9xfsk.receive()
    # If no packet was received during the timeout then None is returned.
    if packet is not None:
        # Received a packet!
