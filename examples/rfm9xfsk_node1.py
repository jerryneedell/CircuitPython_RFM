# Define radio parameters.
RADIO_FREQ_MHZ = 915.0  # Frequency of the radio in Mhz. Must match your
# module! Can be a value like 915.0, 433.0, etc.

# Define pins connected to the chip, use these if wiring up the breakout according to the guide:
CS = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.CE1)
RESET = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D25)

# Initialize SPI bus.
spi = busio.SPI(board.SCK, MOSI=board.MOSI, MISO=board.MISO)
# Initialze RFM radio

# set the time interval (seconds) for sending packets

# Note that the radio is configured in LoRa mode so you can't control sync
# word, encryption, frequency deviation, or other settings!

# You can however adjust the transmit power (in dB).  The default is 13 dB but
# high power radios like the RFM95 can go up to 23 dB:
# rfm9xfsk.tx_power = 23


# initialize counter

    # If no packet was received during the timeout then None is returned.
    if packet is not None:
        # Received a packet!
        # Print out the raw bytes of the packet:
