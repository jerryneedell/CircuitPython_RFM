# Example using Interrupts to send a message and then wait indefinitely for messages
# to be received. Interrupts are used only for receive. sending is done with polling.
# This example is for systems that support interrupts like the Raspberry Pi with "blinka"
# CircuitPython does not support interrupts so it will not work on  Circutpython boards
